- `Context Middleware`, provide information about the current execution context which can be used to build generic guards, filters, and interceptors that can work across a broad set of controllers, methods, and execution contexts.
- `AbstractDto`,  an object that is used to encapsulate data, and send it from one subsystem of an application to another subsystem, module, etc.
- `AbstractEntity`, is moslty object-design-based solution to make TypeORM works as expected.
